## Testing 

- I tested the page to work on Chrome and Firefox. 

- I confirmed that the project functions on pc and mobile. 

- I confirm that the links are easy to read and function. 

- The form functions and all fields must be filled and only an email wil be accepted in the email field. 

### Bugs 
No bugs to report. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
    - A stray closing tag was found, removed. 

- CSS
    - The method I used to fix the Header and Footer tight to the top and bottom of the page was wrong, "bottom: 1;" and "top: 1;" were used in the Header and Footer respectfully and acieved my intended vision, but numbers other than 0 must have a unit after them. This broke my design so I decided to remove this feature when I couldn't find another solution. 

- Accessibility 
    - Confirmed the layout and design of my site are easy to read and accessible by running light house.

## Deployment 

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
